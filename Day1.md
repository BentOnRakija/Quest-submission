A blockchain is a distributed database operated and maintained by a network of computer nodes. 

A smart contract is a program that can be stored and executed on the blockchain allowing users to interact with it through specific functions. 

Transactions can change the state of the blockchain and cost money. Scripts can read the state of the blockchain and are free.
