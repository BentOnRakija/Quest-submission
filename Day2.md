3. Clarity can help developers read code code quickly and efficiently thus reducing hours wasted trying to break down complicated code. 
4. Approachability allows programmers to adapt to a new language without having them start from ground zero. 
5. Developer Experience is extremely beneficial to programmers looking to write in Cadence as there are limited resources available compared to traditional programming languages.
